#  Vape Market Analysis in NZ
### This was part of the interview process for the Part-time Retail Assistant and IT Support role at Vape Mart, Wellington.

**1.	Market Analysis**  
o	Q1: Identify the total number of vape shops in New Zealand.  
**Data Collection:**  
Vape Stores: https://vaping.harp.health.nz/search/1DC97E34-E3F1-40E3-ADFE-30092B36F21C  
Postal Code Lists: https://www.addysolutions.com/nz-postcode-list    
**Data Cleaning and Mapping:** 
Extracted postal code from “Physical Address”. If there’s no data in that column, used the postal code from “Business Registered Address”.  

**2.	Demographic Insights**
o	Q3. Provide population data for each city in New Zealand, ideally focusing on the 18+ age group.  
Data Collection: https://explore.data.stats.govt.nz/  
Due to the limitation of datasets, 18 years old and above cannot be extracted from the population data.   
 
o	Q4. Include population distribution by key demographics (e.g., age, gender, etc.) where possible.  
 
**3.	Business Metrics**  
o	Estimate the average number of potential customers per vape shop.
Since there is no specific data for 18 years and above, people 20 years and above can be considered potential vapers. Four million people are in the eligible age group. 1,450 out of 1,660 vape retailers are approved. Therefore, the estimated average number of vapers per store is around 2.7k based on the 20-year-old and above age group.  
o	Research and include any available data on total vape sales in New Zealand.  
No vape sales data available online.   
**4.	Trends and Insights**  
o	Investigate and present data on vape usage by age and demographics.  
o	Highlight any notable trends or insights you find during your research.
